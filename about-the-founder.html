Areas that he engaged included conducting free medical aid programs across the country, programs designed to alleviation of malnutrition and communicable diseases, immunization campaigns, facilitating construction of roads and houses for the poor, women's empowerment programs, Sunday schools educational programs, construction of tube-wells for potable water, provision of clean water and sanitation, micro loaning, and job creations.</p>

Examples are <em>Osteoporosis: Time to Act</em> (in progress) and <em>Vitamin D: Everything You Need to Know</em> (2012), CKD of multi factorial origin (2015). He received multiple awards, including young investigator awards from several professional societies, The Dr. Boy Frame Award for Clinical Excellence in Metabolic Bone Diseases (1993), American Endocrine Society Glen Foundation Awards, and an innovation award from the Asian Chamber of Commerce (2000). In 2005, Dr. Wimalawansa received a coveted Lifetime Achievement Award from the Sri Lanka Foundation, Los Angeles, California for his contributions to science, humanity, and society.

<p>His laboratory and clinical research in pharmaceuticals, peptides, peptide receptors, and metabolic bone diseases was funded primarily by the NIH. He has made many vital contributions to medicine and medical research, including development of once a week bisphosphonates therapy, combination therapies for osteoporosis, a technique to enhance the efficacy of bisphosphonates, and cost-effective therapies such as vitamin E and nitric oxide donor regimens for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. In 1984, Dr. Wimalawansa was the first to develop and demonstrate the value of intra-operative hormone assays using measurements of calcitonin and parathyroid hormones as examples to assist surgical procedures, which is now used worldwide as a standard of practice. He also developed an innovative, highly cost-effective water purification method to provide clean and safe potable water to needy populations, worldwide.</p>
